# BIOS and CMOS

- BIOS stands for basic input output system.
- It is utility program which loads the operating system when computer is on
- CMOS is small battery powered RAM memory that retains user settings and other data required during the booting process.
- Operating system acts as interface between computer system hardware components
- User can't access computer until operating system is fully loaded into the memory RAM
- CPU is brain of the computer and it initialize and seek operating system that computer can boot from
- BIOS is placed in ROM chip(readonly) on the motherboard
- BIOS job is to locate and load the os system in the main system memory RAM.
- Booting process: loading the computer os system
+ To check the power supply to the computer system.
+ Checks essential internal components

### The Main Features of BIOS
- Bios: basic input output system
- Rombios: function is to load the operating system
- Bios is in Rom chip called ROMBIOS
- BIOS chip is powered by CMOS battery

   
- BI OS will pass the control to the memory once its full loaded.
- Features that is provided in the BIOS
    - Control how to select how the storage controllers are visible
    - Adjust microprocessor clocking speed and enabling and disabling components
- CMOS give way to setup which drive to boot from
- CMOS stands for complementary metal oxide semiconductor
- CMOS chip is used to store the critical data used by the operating system during the booting process.
- When computer is on, the BIOS that is stored in the computer's read-only memory microchip.
- CMOS and BIOS works together during the booting process and CMOS  is a Non-volatile RAM because it is powered by the CMOS battery when system switch is off.
- CMOS is battery is five years
- When CMOS memory fails due to any technical issue, boot fails and flashing an error message.
- When CMOS battery fails, it can have current date and time problems.
- The failure of BIOS can be ude to incompatible with existing hardware configuration settings
- CMOS memory can be cleared from within the ROMBIOS menu.
