# The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies

---

- Amazon acquired Elemental technologies to expand on video service which now is Prime video.
- This wasn't only reason for acquisition as Amazon aim to use it's platform for building AWS could for CIA.
- The server for Elemental technologies were created by Super Micro Computer Inc.
- In recent, Elemental staff's boxed up several server to Ontario, Canada for security company to test.
- The tester found small size of microchip that wasn't part of the motherboard.
- The investigator found that chip's allowed attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included altered machines.
- There are two way for spies to affect the computer.
    1. Interdiction: Manipulating devices as they're in transit from manufacturer to customer.
    2. Seeding changes from the very beginning
- This eventually affected 30 companies including major bank, government and Apple.
- Apple also found malicious chips on 2015.
- The motive of attacker, chinese, were to access secrets and sensitive government information.
- Elemental technologies have started from video casting for mormone churches to use its server for national security mission across US government.
- NASA, house of congress and Department of Homeland security have also been customers.
- Today, Supermicro dominates market selling 1 billion market for boards
- Prior to Chinese plan to plant malicious chip into the board, US had an intel on that matters, but nothing was concrete, so they couldn't do anything.
- The chip was planted in a way that can interject the temporary memory en route to CPU and allowed attacker to effectively edit this information queue and able to inject its own code.
- Apple's affiliation to Supermicro perspired when they acquired company Topsy Labs which created superfast technology for indexing and searching vast troves of internet content.
- AWS did in house investigation in their China headquarter and found altered boards.
- After concrete evidence that data were altered, Amazon sold their infrastructure to Beijing Sinnet.
- Apple severed relationship with Supermicro entirely.
- This article portrays that having the low cost to create a motherboard ended up backfiring for some of the big companies and really reflect on possible outcome in the future that might be due to this meddle from alteration.
