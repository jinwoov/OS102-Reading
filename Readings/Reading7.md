# Network Fundamentals

### Types of computer Network
- This can be classified into physical size, mode of connection, types of devices, tec. 
- Well knowns are 
    - `Local Area Network(LAN)`,    
    - `Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)`
    - `Wide Area Network(WAN)`
- LAN involves small area and mostly restricted to one place.
    - this includes like code fellows, or Lan cafe.
- Netorking of a home or office is called SOHO LAN (Small Home Office Local Area Network).
- MAN is a type of computer network that is larger than a LAN.
- MAN requires more administrative checks due to its size.
- WAN is largest form of computer network spanning thousand hectares of land. Requires full administrative check, as failure can be detrimental.
- `OSI`: open system interconnection;
- ROuter makes use of IP addresses at its interface. And is layer 3 of standard of communication.
- Switch is responsible for connecting computers together.
- Layer 2 of OSI model standard of communication.
- Access point is used in place of switch in wireless networking.
- OSI Layers:
    1. Physical
    2. Data-link
    3. Network
    4. Transport
    5. Session
    6. Presentation
    7. Application
- Hub: multiport repeater. Used to connect computers and share data amongst them. 
    - it is known as layer 1 of device on the OSI model
- Ethernet: used to connect to all other networking devices for computer to computer connection.
- Most common is `RJ45` connector
- IP means internet protocol
    - the bus
    - Exists in two version: IPv4 and IPv6.
    - IPv4 is most commonly used
- MAC(Media Access Control) address is  64 bit manufacturer's address burnt on the mother boards of computer. Its unique like fingerprint on human.
- Domain Name Service(DNS) is a translated version of IP address like `Google.com`
- Dynamic host configuration protocol(DHCP) assigns IP automatically in the router.
- VLAN(Virtual Local Area Netowrk) This is done by switch.
- Scalability: Ability of a network to expand such that it gives room for more devices to be interconnected.
