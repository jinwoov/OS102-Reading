---

## From Wiki HOw
1. Determine your computer's use
    - Think about what you are going to use this for
2. Establish a budget
    - Hard limit is necessary to control our impulsive purchase
    - Getting a newer components for 20 bucks will be better in long term
3. Know which components you need to buy
    - Processor - brain
    - Motherboard - Transit between processor and other computer components
    - RAM - Random Access Memory
        - Can determine computer performance
        - More RAM means better performance
        - Less RAM is like having small table
    - Hard Drive - Stores permanent data
        - SSD is more fast drive
    - Power supply
        - generate power for all the components
    - Case - cover for components
    - Graphic cards - supply image to computer
        - GPU - graphic processing unit
    - cooling system - Keep everything cool and a safe temperature

- To Purchase
    - Where to buy components  
        - bestbuy, Amazon, eBay, and NewEgg
    - Look for review
    - Research every components you intend to purchase
    - Find a processor (CPU)
        - this should be a core and main priority
        - Spend the most
    - Buy motherboard that fits your CPU
        - Often motherboard can have "Onboard WIFI"
        - Bluetooth
        - Multiple RAM slots
        - Supports grphic cards(PCIe x16 slot)
    - Purchase ram
        - Responsible for storing running data
    - Hard drive
        - Average has speed of 7200RPM
        - SATA is newer and supports modern motherboard
        - SSD is usually SATA connector
    - Graphic Cards
        - for playing game
        - Should take 1/3 of the budget
    - Make sure that power supply can handle the load
- Assembling Computer
    1. Ground yourself using ESD(electrostatic discharge) cableto prevent any static
    2. Unscrew the side panel and open.
    3. Install power supply
        - it usually go near top or bottom rear of the case
    4. Add the components to the mother board
    5. Apply thermal paste to the processor if necessary.
        - small dot of it on the CPU
    6. Attach the heat sink.
        - most of the cooler attaches to the motherboard directly.
    7. Prepare the case
    8. Secure the motherboard by use secrew to hold it in place
    9. Plug in the case connectors
        - make sure to connect USB ports, power and reset switches and the LED power and hard drive lights and audio cable
    10. Install hard drive
        - remove any front panels on the case
    11. connect power supply to any necessary components 
        ie: motherboard, graphics card, hard drive
    12. Finish your assembly
    13. connect the power and let it rip
